# My Landing Page (using Bootstrap)

My landing page is describing my on-going projects and my portfolio.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

I used [CDN](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) for Bootstrap and Jquery.
You can get full version directly on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

### What I used to build this website :

* [Bootstrap version 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
